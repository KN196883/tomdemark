# tomdemark
Financial charting with Tom DeMark indicator.
This repository was forked from: https://github.com/txjohnny5/Tom-Demark-Indicator

Most part of original `TD-plotter.py` has been transplanted into `tomdemark.py`, although some original function including calculating technical indicators is cut in this version, because there was no need for me.
This is why the original `other_indicators.py` is completely deleted accordingly.
